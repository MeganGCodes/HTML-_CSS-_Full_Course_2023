            Oh
        Uh-uh, uh (blatt, blatt, blatt)
        Uh-uh, uh
        Uh-uh, uh (uh)
        Uh-uh, uh (uh)
        Uh-uh, uh
        Uh-uh, uh (uh-uh, uh)

        Yeah, not livin' enough (ayy)
        This blunt, I'm takin' a puff
        Was startin' to feel like it's us
        No trust, so do as you must (yeah), for real
        Don't know when I stay out of town
        I get dough when I stay out of town

        Five hundred chops, I got five hundred rounds
        Five hundred plots, I got five hundred pounds, yeah
        I'm trustin' nothin' I'm told, honestly
        I'm trustin' half what I'm shown
        I don't pop out, but it's each to they own
        My bitch, she hate when I be on my phone
        Think she forgot, I got me on my phone
        Not safe for me to forget that I'm known

        Argue 'bout bullshit, you know that you grown
        I don't know, the only reason I condone it
        I know how it works, I know you a flirt
        She send me the flick, tagged not safe for work
        Don't get your feelings hurt while tryna lurk
        My bitch want Chanel, then shit, grab a purse
        She told me she bad, I say, "You could do worse"
        I'm born to be blessed, I live with a curse
        When shit is a mess, I'm rollin' up first
        I smoked on my blunt, then I hit the church
        'Cause nobody get where you comin' from

        You know how it get when you goin' numb
        You know what we on, matter how you judged
        Dealin' with bullshit, out of love
        My life a story, it's not a punch-in
        My life a party, it's not a function
        I never needed no introduction
        Know I'm a star, I'm still adjusting
        And I can't go out like that
        You know that's why I'm clutchin'
        And I see it why they overreact
        But all this shit ain't nothin'
        Told me you gon' send the bread you owe me
        Talkin' like you got an option
        She said, "It's like you don't know you a star"

        I tell her that I'm still adjusting
        Yeah, not livin' enough (ayy)
        This blunt, I'm takin' a puff
        Was startin' to feel like it's us
        No trust, so do as you must (Yeah), for real
        Don't know when I stay out of town
        I get dough when I stay out of town

        Five hundred chops, I got five hundred rounds
        Five hundred plots, I got five hundred pounds, yeah
        I'm trustin' nothin' I'm told, honestly
        I'm trustin' half what I'm shown
        I don't pop out, but it's each to they own
        My bitch, she hate when I be on my phone
        Think she forgot, I got me on my phone
        Not safe for me to forget that I'm known
        Argue 'bout bullshit, you know that you grown
        I don't know, the only reason I condone it (yeah, yeah)

        Uh-uh, uh
        Uh-uh, uh
        Uh-uh, uh
        Uh-uh, uh
        Uh-uh, uh
        Uh-uh, uh
        Uh-uh
